> The more something scares you, the more necessary it is to your growth

> Growth is usually painful to some degree. That's because growth requires loss - a loss of your old values, your old behaviors, your old loves, your old identity

> Give up something where the failure feels uninspiring, Instead, double your focus on something where failure feels fun

> "Doing hard things" is a habit that must be practiced, or like all habits, it will be lost

> When you choose what to watch or read, you are choosing your future thoughts and perspectives. Only consume what youd like to become
