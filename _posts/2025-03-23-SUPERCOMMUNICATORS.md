Types of conversations 
- what is this about
- how do we feel about this
- who are we



For effective communication
- control oneself
- control the environment
- control the boundaries



The concept of "controlling oneself" and "controlling the environment" refers to the ability to manage one's own emotions and reactions, and to create a conducive atmosphere for effective communication and connection. 
A more detailed explanation:
Controlling Oneself: Self-Awareness and Emotional Regulation: Supercommunicators are adept at understanding their own emotions and reactions, preventing them from escalating a conversation or damaging a relationship. 
Active Listening and Empathy: They focus on understanding the other person's perspective, rather than immediately reacting or trying to dominate the conversation. 
Self-Reflection: They are able to pause and reflect on their own communication style and its impact on others. 
Managing Conflict: They approach disagreements with a focus on understanding and finding common ground, rather than winning an argument. 

Controlling the Environment:
Creating a Safe Space: Supercommunicators create an environment where people feel comfortable expressing themselves and sharing their thoughts and emotions. 
Understanding Conversation Types: They recognize the different types of conversations (practical, emotional, social) and adapt their approach accordingly. 
Mirroring and Matching: They subtly mirror the communication style of others to build rapport and understanding. 
Asking Questions: They use open-ended questions to encourage deeper conversations and explore different perspectives. 
Facilitating Dialogue: They guide the conversation towards productive outcomes, rather than letting it devolve into unproductive argument
