While my interest stemmed from its ability to run in the JVM, and wasn't looking to get into Android development, i'm glad i went through it and had a fun time learning about Kotlin
-  Concepts like Type aliasing, Elvis operator
-  Statically typed but offers type inference
-  Interoperability (notably with Spring), backwards compatibility and tooling
-  Concurrency via coroutines
-  Functional programming
-  Duality of the `by` keyword 
      - delegates the implementation of an interface to another object
      - delegate the initialization
- using special characters in function names wrapped in backticks
- using the `with` standard function to avoid repeating myMemento.think()
	  

Books that helped me on this summer fling

-  Head First Kotlin from O’Reilly 
-  Kotlin Design Patterns and Best Practices from Packt
-  Kotlin Cookbook from O’Reilly
