Write about the word you wish to embody. Where did you first learn it? What does it mean to you? Who does it allow you to become? what does it allow you to do?

Imagination is the beginning of creation. You imagine what you desire, you will what you imagine and at last you create what you will 

You  dont have to be particularly brave. You just have to be a tiny, tiny bit more interested in something than you are frightened of it
You just have to be one percent more curious than afraid

Sometimes you're so afraid, you dont know where the fear is coming from anymore, and that makes it seem imparsable and totally intractable.
But in writing your fears down, you give them a container, and you can begin to evaluate them-- to see which ones are valid and which ones have no grounding in fact.


"Have pateience with everything unresolved in your heart, and try to love the questions themselves, as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. 
Don't search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them...Live the questions now.
Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually without even noticing it, live your way into the answer"
