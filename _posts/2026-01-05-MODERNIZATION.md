Focus on Answering the following questions:
- What problem are we trying to solve by modernizing?
- What small pragmatic changes will help us learn more about the system?
- What can we iterate on?
- How will we spot problems after we deploy changes?

Challenge the team to design the system with the same requirements of our legacy system using only technology available at the time the legacy system was built, this would allow recovery on some context.
