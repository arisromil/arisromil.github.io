My takeaways for the book : [The Creative Programmer](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-creative-programmer-wouter-groeneveld/19049329?ean=9781633439054)


-  writing things down in my own words and from memory as the book suggests
-  creativity is just the means not a goal
-  switching from focused and diffused thinking
-  deliberately impose constraints to spark creativity
-  let the "liquid network" flow the two extremes of stable and wild ideas
-  have a growth mindset
