the connections between the hand releasing the Slinky (event)

Summary of Systems Principles

• A system is more than the sum of its parts.

• Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the
flow of information.

• The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose,
is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behavior.

• System structure is the source of system behavior. System
behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time.
